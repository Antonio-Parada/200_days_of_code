# 200 Days of Code - Procedures

This document contains general procedures and guidelines for working on projects within the 200 Days of Code challenge.

---

## General Guidelines

*   **Code Quality:** Strive for clean, readable, and well-commented code. Follow best practices for the language and framework you are using.
*   **Testing:** Where applicable, write unit tests or integration tests for your code to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain a `README.md` file within each project folder. This should include:
    *   A clear description of the project.
    *   Instructions on how to set up and run the project.
    *   Any dependencies or prerequisites.
    *   Key design decisions or challenges faced.
*   **Dependencies:** Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv` for Python, `npm install` for Node.js) to manage project-specific dependencies.
*   **Security:** Be mindful of security best practices, especially when dealing with user input, network communication, or sensitive data.
