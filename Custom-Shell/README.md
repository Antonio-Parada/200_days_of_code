# Custom Shell

This project contains implementations of a simple custom shell in three different languages: Python, C, and Go.

The goal is to understand the differences in implementation and the standard libraries available in each language for system-level tasks like reading user input, parsing commands, and executing processes.

## Implementations

- [Python](./python/)
- [C](./c/)
- [Go](./go/)
