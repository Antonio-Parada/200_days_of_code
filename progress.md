This document tracks the completion of projects in the 200 Days of Code challenge.

## Completed Projects

### Real-time Chat Application
- Initial setup with Node.js, Express, Socket.IO.
- Implemented PostgreSQL for database.
- Added user registration and login with password hashing (bcrypt) and session management.
- Developed a modern, responsive UI using Bootstrap and Material Design principles for authentication and chat interfaces.
- Implemented basic private messaging functionality.
- Implemented basic group chat functionality.

**Current Roadblock:** Server error on sign-in due to PostgreSQL connection issues. Need to verify `db.js` credentials match Docker container setup and ensure the database exists within the container.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Resolve PostgreSQL connection issue.
2.  Refine UI/UX (e.g., better styling for active chats/groups, notifications).
3.  Implement persistent chat history (store messages in the database).
4.  Add more advanced chat features (e.g., typing indicators, read receipts).
5.  Work on deployment to a cloud platform.
